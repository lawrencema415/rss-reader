Create a simple web app that renders an RSS feed for a user to browse an RSS Feed (view
sample feeds below). Use your creativity for the Design / UX and please email us if you have
any questions

Requirements:
- The project should be based on React using Javascript.
- Show story headlines in a list
- by clicking on a story headline, all the content for that story provided by the RSS

feed should be rendered in the web app in a separate page.
- Bookmark a story with a UI representing the bookmarked state.
- Persist bookmark state across sessions using your preferred methods
- Given how annoying XML is, feel free to Google search and use a library that converts

the RSS xml format to JSON.
- Don’t use any CSS libraries (eg. Bootstrap, Material UI)
- Be able to view multiple feeds
- Should be responsive on mobile/tablet

Bonus :
- Show the main image for a story along with the headlines in the list.
- How you determine what the ‘main image’ is up to you but it should make sense.
- Social buttons like Facebook Like, Tweet, or email
- Settings where you can select what RSS feeds you want to see with the ability to add.
- User Redux
- Write Tests.
- Use your imagination to add anything else!
- User Authentication using Oauth (any provider)

- Backchannel
- https://medium.com/feed/backchannel
- Techcrunch
- https://techcrunch.com/startups/feed/
- The Economist
